2. Load optional design documents ✓
   → data-model.md: TestSuite, TestCase, TestResult, CoverageReport entities
   → contracts/: test-generator-api.yaml
   → research.md: 90% coverage, visual regression for critical components
3. Generate tasks by category ✓
   → Setup: test infrastructure, utilities, CI/CD
   → Tests: contract tests, integration scenarios
   → Core: test generation for 76 components
   → Integration: E2E tests, visual regression
   → Polish: coverage reporting, documentation
4. Apply task rules ✓
   → Component tests marked [P] (different files)

Task agent="test-runner-2" tasks="T062,T063,T064,T065"
# ... continue pattern
```

## Dependencies & Order

1. **Setup Phase (T001-T008)**: Must complete first, T003-T005 can run in parallel
2. **Contract Tests (T009-T014)**: All can run in parallel after setup
3. **Models (T015-T021)**: All can run in parallel after setup
4. **Component Tests (T022-T090)**: Can all run in parallel after models are created
5. **Integration Tests (T091-T094)**: Run after component tests complete
6. **CI/CD (T095-T098)**: Run after all tests are created
