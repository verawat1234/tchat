# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Component Testing Suite

**Feature Branch**: `005-create-test-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create test for each component --ultrathink"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: need for comprehensive testing of all UI components
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: components, test coverage, test types, quality assurance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Define testing workflow for component library
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Check for completeness and clarity
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need comprehensive automated tests for every UI component in our application to ensure quality, prevent regressions, and maintain consistent behavior across the entire component library. The testing suite should validate functionality, visual appearance, accessibility, and integration behavior for all components identified by our component analyzer.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a UI component exists in the codebase, **When** a developer runs the test suite, **Then** the component should have at least one test file validating its core functionality
2. **Given** a component accepts props, **When** tests are executed, **Then** all required props and their variations should be tested
3. **Given** a component has user interactions, **When** interaction tests run, **Then** all interactive behaviors should be validated (clicks, inputs, keyboard navigation)
4. **Given** a component has accessibility features, **When** accessibility tests run, **Then** WCAG compliance should be verified
5. **Given** tests are run in CI/CD pipeline, **When** any test fails, **Then** the build should fail with clear error messages
6. **Given** a new component is added, **When** tests are generated, **Then** appropriate test templates should be created based on component type

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component has no props? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should prop-less components have different test requirements?]
- How does system handle components with async data loading?
- What happens when components have complex state management?
- How are components with external dependencies tested?
- What happens when visual regression is detected?
- How does system handle flaky tests?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create at least one test file for each of the 76 identified components
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all component props including required, optional, and default values
- **FR-003**: System MUST test component rendering with different prop combinations
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate user interactions (click, type, focus, hover) for interactive components
- **FR-005**: System MUST check accessibility compliance including ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide test coverage reporting with minimum coverage threshold of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum coverage percentage not specified - 80%? 90%?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST categorize tests by component type (Atom, Molecule, Organism) for appropriate testing depth
- **FR-008**: System MUST test component isolation (unit tests) and integration with other components
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate responsive behavior for components with different viewport sizes
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate test reports showing pass/fail status for each component
- **FR-011**: System MUST support visual regression testing for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which components need visual regression - all or specific ones?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST test error states and boundary conditions for data-driven components
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate component performance metrics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance targets not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure tests can run in both development and CI/CD environments
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear error messages and debugging information when tests fail

### Test Coverage Requirements by Component Type
- **Atoms (23 components)**: Basic functionality, prop validation, accessibility
- **Molecules (13 components)**: Component composition, interaction between child components, state management
- **Organisms (40 components)**: Complex interactions, business logic, integration testing, performance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Component**: UI element being tested (name, type, props, dependencies)
- **Test Suite**: Collection of tests for a specific component
- **Test Case**: Individual test scenario (description, input, expected output)
- **Test Result**: Outcome of test execution (pass/fail, error messages, coverage metrics)
- **Coverage Report**: Aggregated metrics showing tested vs untested code paths

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Note**: Three clarifications needed:
1. Minimum test coverage percentage threshold
2. Which components require visual regression testing
3. Specific performance metrics to validate
