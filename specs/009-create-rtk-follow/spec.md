# Feature Specification: RTK Backend API Integration

**Feature Branch**: `009-create-rtk-follow`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create rtk follow backend api"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Parsed: "create rtk follow backend api"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: RTK (Redux Toolkit), backend API integration, data synchronization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked multiple clarifications needed for API structure and endpoints
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Created scenarios for data fetching and state management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Created testable requirements for API integration
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Identified API resources, state management, and error handling
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - multiple clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the application, I need the frontend to stay synchronized with backend data so that I can see real-time information, perform actions that persist to the server, and have a consistent experience across sessions and devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user navigates to a data-driven page, **Then** the application retrieves and displays current data from the backend
2. **Given** the user performs an action (create/update/delete), **When** the action is submitted, **Then** the change is persisted to the backend and the UI reflects the updated state
3. **Given** a network request fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the user sees an appropriate error message and can retry the action
4. **Given** data is being loaded, **When** the request is in progress, **Then** the user sees a loading indicator
5. **Given** the user is authenticated, **When** making API requests, **Then** the requests include proper authentication credentials

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the network connection is lost during a request?
- How does the system handle concurrent modifications from multiple users?
- What happens when the backend returns unexpected data formats?
- How does the system handle API rate limiting or throttling?
- What happens when authentication expires during usage?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST synchronize application state with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which backend API endpoints - user data, messages, settings, etc.?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle all standard REST operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH - which operations are needed?]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to see loading states while data is being fetched
- **FR-004**: System MUST display error messages when API requests fail
- **FR-005**: System MUST cache API responses to reduce unnecessary network requests [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cache duration and invalidation strategy?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle authentication for protected endpoints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - JWT, OAuth, session cookies?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retry failed requests [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retry strategy - exponential backoff, max retries?]
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to manually refresh data when needed
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle pagination for large data sets [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination strategy - cursor, offset, infinite scroll?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate data before sending to backend [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation rules and error handling?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain data consistency across different views showing the same information
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle optimistic updates for better user experience [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rollback strategy on failure?]

### Key Entities
- **API Resources**: The data entities managed by the backend (users, messages, products, etc.) that need to be fetched, created, updated, and deleted
- **Request State**: The loading, success, and error states for each API operation
- **Cached Data**: Previously fetched data stored locally to improve performance and reduce API calls
- **Authentication State**: User credentials and tokens needed for authorized API access
- **Error Information**: Details about failed requests including error codes, messages, and recovery options

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Note**: Multiple clarifications needed regarding:
- Specific API endpoints and resources to integrate
- Authentication method and token management
- Caching and data invalidation strategies
- Error handling and retry policies
- Pagination approach
- Optimistic update rollback strategy
