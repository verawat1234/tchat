# Implementation Plan: RTK Backend API Integration

**Branch**: `009-create-rtk-follow` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-create-rtk-follow/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✓
   → Spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) ✓
   → Detected Web Application project type (React frontend)
   → Set Structure Decision to Option 2 (frontend/backend)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on constitution template ✓
   → Using default principles as constitution is template
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No violations found with simplified RTK approach
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✓
   → Resolved all clarifications with standard patterns
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✓
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No new violations found
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Task generation approach described ✓
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command ✓
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Creating Redux Toolkit (RTK) infrastructure to synchronize frontend application state with backend APIs, providing efficient data fetching, caching, error handling, and optimistic updates for enhanced user experience. Based on research, implementing RTK Query for API integration with standard REST patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3.0 / JavaScript ES2020+
**Primary Dependencies**: Redux Toolkit 2.0+, RTK Query, React 18.3.1
**Storage**: RTK store for client state, localStorage for persistence
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, MSW for API mocking
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: web - React frontend with backend API integration
**Performance Goals**: <100ms UI updates, <500ms API responses, optimistic updates
**Constraints**: Minimize API calls via caching, handle offline scenarios
**Scale/Scope**: Support for 10+ API endpoints, 100+ concurrent users

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles (Default)
- [x] **Library-First**: RTK is a standalone library with clear purpose
- [x] **CLI Interface**: Not applicable for frontend state management
- [x] **Test-First**: Contract tests and mocks will be created first
- [x] **Integration Testing**: API integration tests required
- [x] **Observability**: Redux DevTools provide full observability
- [x] **Simplicity**: Using RTK Query's built-in patterns, no custom abstractions

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application structure (frontend/backend separation)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - API endpoint structure and resources
   - Authentication method (JWT vs OAuth)
   - Caching strategies
   - Error handling patterns
   - Pagination approach
   - Optimistic update strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research RTK Query best practices for REST API integration"
   Task: "Find optimal caching strategies for RTK Query"
   Task: "Research authentication patterns with RTK Query"
   Task: "Find pagination patterns for RTK Query"
   Task: "Research optimistic update strategies in RTK"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: RTK Query with createApi for all endpoints
   - Rationale: Built-in caching, automatic re-fetching, TypeScript support
   - Alternatives considered: Plain Redux + fetch, Axios + thunks, TanStack Query

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User entity with auth tokens
   - Resource entities (determined from existing backend)
   - Request/Response types
   - Error response format

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh)
   - CRUD operations for each resource
   - Pagination parameters
   - Error response schemas
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - MSW handlers for each endpoint
   - Schema validation tests
   - Error scenario tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Data fetching on navigation
   - CRUD operation flows
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Optimistic update rollbacks

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add RTK and RTK Query to tech stack
   - Update recent changes

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create store configuration task [P]
- Create base API service task [P]
- Each resource → API slice task [P]
- Authentication flow tasks
- Caching configuration tasks
- Error handling middleware task
- Integration test tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Store setup first
- Base API configuration
- Auth service before protected endpoints
- Resource services in parallel [P]
- Integration tests last

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - using standard RTK patterns*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
