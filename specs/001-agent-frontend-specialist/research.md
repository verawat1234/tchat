# Research: Common UI Component Breakdown

**Feature**: Common UI Component Breakdown
**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Complete

## Research Questions & Findings

### 1. Current Component Patterns in Tchat Codebase

**Decision**: Follow existing component structure with new `common/` directory
**Rationale**: Maintains existing patterns while creating clear separation for reusable components
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate npm package: Rejected due to added complexity for single application
- Flat component structure: Rejected as it would mix reusable and page-specific components

**Current Structure Analysis**:
- Existing: `src/components/ui/` contains Radix UI wrapper components
- Existing: Page-level components mixed throughout `src/components/`
- Pattern: TypeScript interfaces, React functional components, TailwindCSS styling
- Naming: PascalCase component names, kebab-case file names

### 2. Existing Theme System Implementation

**Decision**: Leverage TailwindCSS v4 design tokens and CSS custom properties
**Rationale**: Already implemented in codebase, supports theming out of the box
**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS-in-JS solution: Rejected as TailwindCSS already provides what's needed
- Styled-components: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing approach

**Current Theme Analysis**:
- TailwindCSS v4 with built-in design tokens
- CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography
- Dark/light mode support via `next-themes`
- Responsive design patterns established

### 3. Component Testing Strategies

**Decision**: React Testing Library + Vitest for unit tests, Storybook for component documentation
**Rationale**: Industry standard, good TypeScript support, fast test execution
**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Rejected as Vitest is already configured and faster with Vite
- Enzyme: Rejected as it's deprecated and React Testing Library is preferred

**Testing Approach**:
- Unit tests: Render testing, prop validation, interaction testing
- Visual tests: Storybook stories with controls
- Integration tests: Component composition scenarios
- Accessibility tests: Built into React Testing Library

### 4. Component Documentation Strategy

**Decision**: Storybook with TypeScript integration and auto-generated prop docs
**Rationale**: Provides interactive documentation, supports design system workflows
**Alternatives considered**:
- Docusaurus: Rejected as Storybook is better for component libraries
- Custom documentation: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

**Documentation Features**:
- Auto-generated prop tables from TypeScript interfaces
- Interactive component playground
- Design token visualization
- Usage examples and best practices

### 5. Component Priority and Scope

**Decision**: Focus on 8 core components based on user requirements
**Rationale**: Addresses most common UI patterns while keeping scope manageable
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full component library: Rejected as too large for initial implementation
- Minimal set: Rejected as it wouldn't cover enough use cases

**Core Components Identified**:
1. **Pagination** - Navigation through large datasets
2. **Tabs** - Content organization and navigation
3. **Card** - Content containers with consistent styling
4. **ChatMessage** - Message display with different types (text, media, system)
5. **Badge** - Status indicators and labels
6. **Layout** - Grid and flexbox layout utilities
7. **Header** - Application and section headers
8. **Sidebar** - Navigation and content panels

### 6. Component Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: Composition-based architecture with render props and compound components
**Rationale**: Provides flexibility while maintaining consistency
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single component with many props: Rejected as it creates unwieldy APIs
- Higher-order components: Rejected in favor of modern React patterns

**Architecture Principles**:
- Compound components for complex UI (e.g., Tabs.Root, Tabs.List, Tabs.Content)
- Render props for flexible content rendering
- Forwarded refs for integration with libraries
- Controlled and uncontrolled variants where appropriate

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Code splitting at component level, lazy loading for heavy components
**Rationale**: Maintains fast loading while supporting rich interactions
**Alternatives considered**:
- Bundle everything: Rejected due to performance impact
- External component library: Rejected to maintain control over bundle size

**Performance Strategy**:
- Dynamic imports for complex components
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Bundle size monitoring per component
- Tree shaking optimization

## Technology Stack Summary

**Primary Technologies**:
- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.3.0
- TailwindCSS v4 for styling and theming
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Framer Motion for animations
- Vite 6.3.5 for build tooling

**Development Tools**:
- Storybook for component documentation
- React Testing Library + Vitest for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- TypeScript for type safety

**Integration Points**:
- Existing Radix UI components in `ui/` directory
- TailwindCSS theme system
- Next-themes for dark mode support
- Existing component patterns and naming conventions

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase Approach**:
1. **Foundation**: Core components (Card, Badge, Layout)
2. **Navigation**: Tabs, Pagination, Sidebar
3. **Complex**: ChatMessage with multiple types, Header
4. **Integration**: Storybook setup, testing, documentation

**Quality Gates**:
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- All tests passing with >90% coverage
- Storybook stories for all components
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance budgets met (<50KB per component)

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Using existing technology stack
- Following established patterns
- Clear component boundaries

**Medium Risk**:
- ChatMessage complexity with multiple types
- Integration with existing components
- Performance optimization for animations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Start with simple components first
- Incremental integration approach
- Performance monitoring from day one
- Regular testing with existing codebase
