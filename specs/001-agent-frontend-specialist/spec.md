# Feature Specification: Common UI Component Breakdown

**Feature Branch**: `001-agent-frontend-specialist`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@agent-frontend-specialist breakdown common ui to common components --ultrathink"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Break down common UI patterns into reusable components
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Frontend developers, designers, product team
   ’ Actions: Identify, extract, standardize, reuse UI components
   ’ Data: Existing UI patterns, component definitions, design tokens
   ’ Constraints: Must maintain current functionality and visual consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific UI patterns should be prioritized?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this include design system documentation?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: Developer reuses components, maintains consistency
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on component reusability and consistency
6. Identify Key Entities: UI Components, Design Patterns, Component Library
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties about prioritization and scope"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a frontend developer working on the Tchat messaging platform, I need common UI elements to be available as reusable components so that I can build consistent interfaces faster, reduce code duplication, and maintain design consistency across the entire application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer is building a new chat feature, **When** they need a button component, **Then** they can import and use a standardized button component that matches the design system
2. **Given** a designer updates the visual styling for buttons, **When** the component library is updated, **Then** all instances of buttons across the application automatically reflect the new design
3. **Given** a new team member joins the project, **When** they need to build UI features, **Then** they can discover and use existing components through clear documentation and examples
4. **Given** the product team wants to ensure brand consistency, **When** components are used across different screens, **Then** all similar UI elements have identical behavior and appearance
5. **Given** a developer is debugging a UI issue, **When** they identify the problem is in a common pattern, **Then** fixing it in the component automatically resolves the issue everywhere it's used

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component needs slight variations for different contexts?
- How does system handle when existing code conflicts with new component patterns?
- What happens when components need to be updated without breaking existing implementations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all recurring UI patterns currently implemented across the Tchat application
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract common UI elements into reusable component definitions that maintain current functionality
- **FR-003**: Components MUST be able to accept configuration props to handle different use cases and contexts
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear component documentation with usage examples and API specifications
- **FR-005**: Components MUST maintain visual and behavioral consistency with the current Telegram SEA Edition design
- **FR-006**: System MUST support component composition allowing smaller components to build larger interface elements
- **FR-007**: Components MUST be accessible and follow WCAG guidelines for inclusive design
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide automated testing for each component to ensure reliability across different scenarios
- **FR-009**: Components MUST support theming and customization through design tokens [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Current theming system not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST track component usage to identify adoption patterns and optimization opportunities
- **FR-011**: Components MUST have clear versioning to manage updates and breaking changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Versioning strategy not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide migration guides when component APIs change to minimize developer friction

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **UI Component**: Reusable interface element with defined props, styling, behavior, and documentation
- **Design Pattern**: Common UI arrangement or interaction model identified across multiple screens
- **Component Library**: Collection of standardized components with shared design tokens and guidelines
- **Usage Example**: Demonstration of component implementation showing different configurations and contexts
- **Design Token**: Standardized values for colors, typography, spacing, and other design properties
- **Component Documentation**: Specifications including props, usage guidelines, accessibility notes, and examples
