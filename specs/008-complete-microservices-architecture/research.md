# Research: Enterprise-Grade Tchat Backend Platform

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Context**: Microservices architecture for Southeast Asian messaging and commerce platform

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Language & Framework
- **Decision**: Go 1.22+ with Gin HTTP framework
- **Rationale**:
  - High performance and concurrency for real-time messaging
  - Strong ecosystem for microservices (gRPC, REST APIs)
  - Excellent tooling for testing and debugging
  - Memory efficient for containerized deployment
  - Strong community support for enterprise patterns
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Node.js (rejected: single-threaded limitations for high concurrency)
  - Java/Spring Boot (rejected: higher memory overhead)
  - Python/FastAPI (rejected: performance constraints for real-time features)

### Database Architecture
- **Decision**: Multi-database approach
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data (users, payments, business data)
  - ScyllaDB for message storage and timelines
  - Redis for caching and session management
  - Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Rationale**:
  - PostgreSQL: ACID compliance for financial transactions, complex queries
  - ScyllaDB: High-performance message storage with linear scalability
  - Redis: Sub-millisecond caching and WebSocket session management
  - Kafka: Reliable event streaming between microservices
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single PostgreSQL (rejected: messaging scale limitations)
  - MongoDB (rejected: weaker consistency guarantees for payments)
  - RabbitMQ instead of Kafka (rejected: lower throughput requirements)

### Authentication & Security
- **Decision**: JWT-based authentication with OTP verification
- **Rationale**:
  - Regional compliance with phone number verification
  - Stateless authentication for microservices scaling
  - Secure token management with refresh rotation
  - Compatible with mobile and web clients
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - OAuth2 (added complexity for SEA market)
  - Session-based auth (scaling challenges)
  - Blockchain identity (premature for current market)

### Real-time Communication
- **Decision**: WebSocket with Redis backing for connection management
- **Rationale**:
  - Native WebSocket support in Go
  - Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
  - Low latency requirements (<2s message delivery)
  - Compatible with load balancing
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Server-Sent Events (rejected: unidirectional limitation)
  - gRPC streaming (rejected: browser compatibility)
  - Socket.io (rejected: protocol overhead)

### Regional Payment Integration
- **Decision**: Multi-gateway approach (Stripe + Omise)
- **Rationale**:
  - Stripe: Global coverage and reliability
  - Omise: Southeast Asian specialization and local methods
  - Regulatory compliance across 6 countries
  - Redundancy for payment processing
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single gateway (rejected: regional coverage gaps)
  - Blockchain payments (rejected: regulatory uncertainty)
  - Direct bank integration (rejected: complexity and maintenance)

## Microservices Architecture Patterns

### Service Decomposition Strategy
- **Decision**: Domain-driven service boundaries
  - Auth Service: User management and authentication
  - Messaging Service: Real-time communication and chat
  - Payment Service: Multi-currency wallets and transactions
  - Commerce Service: Shop and product management
  - Notification Service: Multi-channel messaging
- **Rationale**:
  - Clear business domain separation
  - Independent scaling based on usage patterns
  - Team ownership alignment
  - Technology stack optimization per service
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Monolithic architecture (rejected: scaling limitations)
  - Function-based services (rejected: tight coupling)
  - Single-responsibility microservices (rejected: operational overhead)

### Inter-Service Communication
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach
  - Synchronous: HTTP/REST for request-response
  - Asynchronous: Kafka events for decoupling
  - Direct database access within service boundaries
- **Rationale**:
  - REST for simple CRUD operations
  - Events for complex business workflows
  - Data ownership and consistency per service
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - gRPC only (rejected: debugging complexity)
  - Event-driven only (rejected: latency for simple operations)
  - Shared database (rejected: tight coupling)

### Container Orchestration
- **Decision**: Kubernetes with Docker containers
- **Rationale**:
  - Industry standard for microservices deployment
  - Horizontal scaling and load balancing
  - Health checks and automatic recovery
  - Multi-cloud portability
  - Rich ecosystem for monitoring and logging
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Docker Swarm (rejected: limited enterprise features)
  - Serverless functions (rejected: cold start latency)
  - VM-based deployment (rejected: resource efficiency)

## Regional Compliance Research

### Data Protection Requirements
- **Decision**: Implement data residency options with encryption
- **Rationale**:
  - GDPR compliance for global users
  - Local data protection laws (PDPA in Thailand, Singapore)
  - User consent management
  - Right to be forgotten implementation
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single region deployment (rejected: latency and compliance)
  - No encryption at rest (rejected: security requirements)

### Payment Compliance
- **Decision**: Multi-jurisdiction compliance framework
- **Rationale**:
  - PCI DSS for card data handling
  - Local payment method support
  - Currency conversion transparency
  - Transaction audit trails
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single country operation (rejected: market opportunity)
  - Third-party payment handling only (rejected: user experience)

### Content Moderation
- **Decision**: Automated + human moderation pipeline
- **Rationale**:
  - Regional content policies
  - Multi-language support
  - Scalable moderation for high message volume
  - Cultural sensitivity considerations
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Manual moderation only (rejected: scale limitations)
  - No moderation (rejected: regulatory requirements)

## Performance & Scalability Research

### Load Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Comprehensive performance testing framework
- **Rationale**:
  - 1000+ RPS authentication target
  - 10K+ concurrent WebSocket connections
  - Sub-200ms P95 API latency requirements
  - Regional load distribution testing
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Go testing package for unit tests
  - testcontainers-go for integration tests
  - Custom load testing for WebSocket connections
  - Playwright for end-to-end testing

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Decision**: Multi-layer monitoring approach
- **Rationale**:
  - Prometheus metrics for technical monitoring
  - Business metrics for platform health

- **Tools selected**:
  - Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Health check endpoints for service monitoring
  - Custom dashboards for business metrics

### Caching Strategy
- **Decision**: Multi-level caching architecture
- **Rationale**:
  - Redis for session and API response caching
  - In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - CDN for static content and media files
  - Database query optimization and indexing
- **Cache policies**:
  - User sessions: 1-hour TTL with refresh
  - API responses: 5-minute TTL for read-heavy data
  - Static content: Long-term caching with versioning

## Documentation Strategy

### API Documentation
- **Decision**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with interactive documentation
- **Rationale**:
  - Industry standard for REST API documentation
  - Interactive testing capabilities
  - Code generation for client SDKs
  - Version control for API changes

- **Rationale**:
  - Multiple deployment options (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, AWS ECS)
  - Incident response procedures
  - Performance tuning guides
  - Disaster recovery procedures
- **Coverage**: Development setup, deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting

### Developer Experience
- **Decision**: Complete development environment automation
- **Rationale**:
  - Docker Compose for local development
  - Automated testing and code quality checks
  - Contributing guidelines and code review standards
  - IDE configuration and debugging support
- **Tools**: Make files for common tasks, VS Code configurations, linting rules

## Risk Mitigation

- **Real-time messaging scale**: Mitigation through Redis clustering and connection pooling
- **Payment processing reliability**: Mitigation through multi-gateway redundancy
- **Database performance**: Mitigation through read replicas and query optimization
- **Service coordination**: Mitigation through circuit breakers and graceful degradation
