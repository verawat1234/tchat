## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **Southeast Asian business owner**, I need a reliable messaging and commerce platform that allows me to:
- Communicate with customers in real-time using local languages
- Process payments in local currencies with regional payment methods
- Manage my online shop with products and inventory
- Receive timely notifications about business activities
- Operate with confidence knowing the platform meets local compliance requirements

As an **end user in Southeast Asia**, I need to:
- Register and authenticate using my mobile phone number
- Send messages and media to individuals and groups in real-time
- Make payments and transfers using local currency and payment methods
- Shop for products from local businesses
- Receive notifications in my preferred language

As a **platform operator**, I need to:
- Monitor system health and performance in real-time
- Deploy updates without service interruption
- Scale the platform to handle growing user base
- Ensure compliance with regional regulations
- Access comprehensive documentation for operations and troubleshooting

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### User Authentication & Onboarding
1. **Given** a new user in Thailand, **When** they register with their mobile number, **Then** they receive an OTP in Thai language and can complete registration
2. **Given** an existing user, **When** they log in from a new device, **Then** they receive security verification and can access their account safely
3. **Given** a user registration attempt, **When** the phone number format is invalid for the country, **Then** the system provides clear guidance on correct format

#### Real-time Messaging
1. **Given** two users in a conversation, **When** one sends a message, **Then** the other receives it within 2 seconds with delivery confirmation
2. **Given** a user creating a group chat, **When** they add participants from different countries, **Then** all participants can communicate using their preferred languages
3. **Given** a user sending media files, **When** the file exceeds size limits, **Then** they receive clear guidance on acceptable file sizes

#### Payment Processing
1. **Given** a user in Indonesia, **When** they make a payment in IDR, **Then** the transaction processes successfully using local payment methods
2. **Given** a cross-border transaction, **When** currency conversion is needed, **Then** users see transparent exchange rates and fees
3. **Given** a failed payment, **When** the user retries, **Then** they receive clear error messages and suggested alternative payment methods

#### Business Operations
1. **Given** a shop owner in Malaysia, **When** they list products in MYR, **Then** customers can browse and purchase using local payment methods
2. **Given** a business receiving orders, **When** inventory runs low, **Then** they receive automated notifications to restock
3. **Given** multiple businesses operating, **When** system load increases, **Then** performance remains consistent for all users

#### Platform Operations
1. **Given** system maintenance is required, **When** operators deploy updates, **Then** users experience zero downtime
2. **Given** unusual traffic patterns, **When** load spikes occur, **Then** the system automatically scales to maintain performance
3. **Given** a security incident, **When** threats are detected, **Then** operators receive immediate alerts with actionable information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users attempt to register from unsupported countries?
- How does the system handle payment processing when external gateways are unavailable?
- What occurs when message delivery fails due to network issues?
- How are transactions handled when currency conversion rates fluctuate significantly?
- What happens when the system reaches maximum capacity limits?
- How does the platform maintain compliance when regulations change?
