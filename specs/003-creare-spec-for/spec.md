## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature request: Implement native mobile UI components following existing web design system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Mobile app users, native developers (Android Kotlin, iOS Swift)
   → Actions: Create native UI components, implement design system parity
   → Data: Existing Radix UI + TailwindCSS v4 + Framer Motion design system
   → Constraints: Native platform guidelines, existing web implementation (EPIC 2, 11, 19.7)
3. Current architecture analysis:
   → Native apps: Android (Kotlin) + iOS (Swift) projects exist at /apps/mobile/
   → Web implementation: Complete React 18.3.1 + comprehensive UI (40+ components)
   → Design system: Radix UI + TailwindCSS v4 + Framer Motion with dark mode
   → Features completed: 5-tab navigation, touch gestures, notifications, video, workspace
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary user flow: Seamless transition from PWA to native apps
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Based on existing web implementation and EPIC 10 (Mobile Apps)
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Native Design Tokens, Platform-Specific Components, Gesture Systems
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Architecture clear: Native infrastructure exists, web design system complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (specification ready for native implementation planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users who are familiar with the comprehensive Tchat web application (featuring 5-tab navigation, advanced UI components, video streaming, workspace management, and touch-optimized interactions) should experience the same visual consistency, interaction patterns, and feature completeness when using the native Android and iOS applications. The transition between PWA and native apps should be seamless, with native apps providing enhanced performance and platform-specific capabilities while maintaining the established design language.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user familiar with the web's 5-tab navigation (Chat/Store/Social/Video/More), **When** they open the native mobile app, **Then** they should find identical navigation structure and visual hierarchy
2. **Given** a user accustomed to web touch gestures (swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh), **When** they perform the same gestures on native apps, **Then** the interactions should behave identically with appropriate platform-specific feedback
3. **Given** the web's comprehensive notification system (5 categories, unread counts), **When** users receive notifications on native apps, **Then** the visual presentation and categorization should match exactly
4. **Given** the web's dark mode and theming capabilities, **When** users switch themes on native apps, **Then** the color palettes and design tokens should maintain perfect consistency
5. **Given** the web's workspace management and video streaming features, **When** users access these on native apps, **Then** the functionality should be equivalent with native performance optimizations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when native platform gestures (iOS edge swipes, Android back gesture) conflict with web-defined gestures?
- How does the native app handle features like video streaming that may have platform-specific implementation requirements?
- How are web-specific animations (Framer Motion) translated to native platform animations while maintaining visual consistency?
- What happens when users switch between PWA and native app mid-workflow (e.g., during video call, shopping cart session)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Native applications MUST implement all 40+ web UI components with pixel-perfect visual consistency using native platform technologies
- **FR-002**: Native applications MUST support the complete 5-tab navigation architecture (Chat/Store/Social/Video/More) with identical information architecture
- **FR-003**: Native applications MUST provide equivalent touch gesture system including swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh, and haptic feedback as implemented in web version
- **FR-004**: Native applications MUST implement the complete notification system with 5 categories, unread count management, and real-time updates matching web behavior
- **FR-005**: Native applications MUST support dark mode and theming with identical color palettes and design tokens as the TailwindCSS v4 implementation
- **FR-006**: Native applications MUST provide workspace management functionality equivalent to the web implementation including workspace switching and role management
- **FR-007**: Native applications MUST support video streaming and content discovery features with native performance optimizations while maintaining UI consistency
- **FR-008**: Native applications MUST implement keyboard detection and viewport management equivalent to the web's mobile optimization
- **FR-009**: Native applications MUST provide shopping cart and commerce flows matching the web implementation with platform-specific payment integrations
- **FR-010**: Native applications MUST maintain session synchronization with web application for seamless cross-platform user experience

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Native Design Token System**: Platform-specific implementation of TailwindCSS v4 design tokens including typography scales, color palettes, spacing units, and animation curves for Android (Compose) and iOS (SwiftUI)
- **Cross-Platform Component Library**: Native equivalents of 40+ Radix UI components optimized for each platform while maintaining visual and behavioral consistency
- **Gesture and Animation System**: Native implementations of web-defined touch gestures and Framer Motion animations using platform-appropriate technologies (Android MotionLayout, iOS UIViewPropertyAnimator)
- **State Synchronization Layer**: System for maintaining consistent user state, notifications, and workspace context between PWA and native applications
- **Platform Integration Adapters**: Native integrations for platform-specific features (iOS Universal Links, Android SMS autofill, platform payment systems) while maintaining cross-platform UX consistency

- **Performance**: Native app load times <2s, gesture response <100ms
- **Cross-Platform UX**: Seamless user transition between PWA and native apps with session continuity

### Dependencies
- **EPIC 10 Implementation**: Native app skeleton and navigation (Stories 10.1-10.4)
- **Design System Completion**: Current Radix UI + TailwindCSS v4 implementation serves as source of truth
- **Backend Integration**: Authentication, messaging, and commerce APIs for full functionality
- **EPIC 2.2 Component Parity**: Android Compose and iOS SwiftUI component development

This specification is ready for technical planning and implementation based on the existing comprehensive web implementation and native app infrastructure.
