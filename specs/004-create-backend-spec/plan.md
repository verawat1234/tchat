# Implementation Plan: Backend Services Architecture

**Branch**: `004-create-backend-spec` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/Users/weerawat/Tchat/specs/004-create-backend-spec/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/weerawat/Tchat/specs/004-create-backend-spec/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Comprehensive backend services architecture for Telegram SEA Edition supporting authentication, real-time messaging, e-commerce, payments, and content management across Southeast Asian markets. The system requires microservices architecture with 99.9% uptime, sub-200ms message delivery, support for 100K+ concurrent users, and compliance with regional regulations (PDPA, PCI DSS). Technical approach includes Go-based microservices with event sourcing, distributed transactions, and multi-region deployment.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (microservices backend architecture)
**Primary Dependencies**: Go standard library, gRPC, protocol buffers, JWT authentication, message brokers (Kafka/RabbitMQ), WebSocket libraries
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), ScyllaDB/Cassandra (timelines), Redis (caching), CDN (static assets)
**Testing**: Go testing framework, testify, contract testing with OpenAPI, integration tests with test containers
**Target Platform**: Kubernetes clusters on cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) with multi-region deployment across SEA
**Project Type**: web (backend microservices + frontend integration)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms message delivery, <100ms API responses (95th percentile), 1000+ payment transactions/minute, 100K+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: 99.9% uptime SLA, PCI DSS Level 1 compliance, PDPA compliance, sub-100ms CDN delivery, 4-hour RTO disaster recovery
**Scale/Scope**: SEA regional deployment (6 countries), 5 core microservices, event-driven architecture, distributed transaction management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Library-First Principle**: ✅ PASS - Each microservice designed as independent library with clear interfaces
**CLI Interface**: ✅ PASS - Each service exposes functionality via gRPC and REST APIs with JSON I/O
**Test-First**: ✅ PASS - Contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests required before implementation
**Integration Testing**: ✅ PASS - Critical for inter-service communication, shared schemas, and external integrations
**Observability**: ✅ PASS - Structured logging, distributed tracing, and monitoring across all services
**Simplicity**: ✅ PASS - Start with 5 core services, avoid premature optimization, follow YAGNI principles

**Initial Assessment**: No constitution violations detected. Design follows microservices best practices with clear service boundaries.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Based on Technical Context indicating backend microservices + frontend integration

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
