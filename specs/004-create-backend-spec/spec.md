## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams need a comprehensive backend services architecture that supports the Telegram SEA Edition platform's core functionalities including user authentication, real-time messaging, e-commerce transactions, payments processing, and content management across Southeast Asian markets.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Core Functionality Scenarios**
1. **Given** a frontend application with defined schemas, **When** backend services are implemented, **Then** all frontend data contracts must be fulfilled with proper API endpoints responding within 100ms for 95% of requests
2. **Given** users across Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, and Philippines, **When** they interact with the platform, **Then** backend services must handle regional requirements including currencies, languages, payment methods, and data localization compliance
3. **Given** real-time messaging requirements, **When** users send messages, **Then** backend must provide sub-200ms message delivery with 99.5% success rate and real-time presence updates
4. **Given** e-commerce functionality, **When** users make purchases, **Then** backend must handle payment processing, inventory management, and order fulfillment workflows with distributed transaction integrity
5. **Given** multi-workspace business requirements, **When** users switch contexts, **Then** backend must maintain data isolation, proper authorization, and workspace-specific business rules

**Performance & Scale Scenarios**
6. **Given** 100,000 concurrent users online, **When** the system operates at peak capacity, **Then** backend must maintain 99.9% uptime with no service degradation
7. **Given** burst traffic conditions, **When** traffic increases to 5x normal load, **Then** backend must handle the spike for 10 minutes using auto-scaling mechanisms
8. **Given** payment processing requirements, **When** 1,000+ transactions occur per minute, **Then** backend must process all payments with proper validation and fraud detection
9. **Given** file upload operations, **When** users upload files up to 100MB, **Then** backend must complete processing within 30 seconds including virus scanning and CDN distribution
10. **Given** cross-region operations, **When** users access services from different SEA countries, **Then** backend must provide sub-100ms CDN response times and comply with data residency requirements

**Security & Compliance Scenarios**
11. **Given** user authentication requirements, **When** users log in from multiple devices, **When** backend must provide JWT-based authentication with 15-minute token expiry and secure session management
12. **Given** payment data processing, **When** financial transactions occur, **Then** backend must encrypt all sensitive data using AES-256 and maintain PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
13. **Given** regulatory compliance requirements, **When** processing user data, **Then** backend must comply with PDPA requirements and provide data export/deletion within 30 days
14. **Given** security threat scenarios, **When** malicious activity is detected, **Then** backend must implement DDoS protection, malware scanning, and real-time security alerting
15. **Given** audit requirements, **When** financial transactions and sensitive operations occur, **Then** backend must maintain comprehensive audit logs with tamper-proof storage

**Resilience & Error Handling Scenarios**
16. **Given** external service failures, **When** payment gateways or SMS providers become unavailable, **Then** backend must implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation with automatic failover
17. **Given** database connectivity issues, **When** primary database connections fail, **Then** backend must automatically failover to read replicas with minimal service disruption
18. **Given** message delivery failures, **When** real-time message delivery fails, **Then** backend must store messages in dead letter queues and retry with exponential backoff
19. **Given** disaster recovery scenarios, **When** regional service outages occur, **Then** backend must recover within 4 hours RTO and maintain 15-minute RPO for critical data
20. **Given** distributed transaction failures, **When** complex workflows spanning multiple services fail, **Then** backend must implement saga patterns for transaction rollback and data consistency

### Edge Cases

**Regional & Compliance Edge Cases**
- What happens when backend services receive invalid currency combinations or payment methods not supported in specific regions, and how does the system handle regional payment gateway failures?
- How does the system handle PDPA data deletion requests when user data spans multiple services and regions with different data residency requirements?
- What occurs when KYC verification fails mid-transaction and how does the system handle tier-based transaction limit enforcement across regions with different regulations?

**Performance & Scale Edge Cases**
- How does the system handle messaging when users are offline for extended periods and message queues exceed storage limits, particularly with 100K+ concurrent users?
- What occurs when inventory levels change during active cart sessions across multiple user sessions, and how does the system prevent overselling during high-traffic periods?
- How does the system maintain real-time messaging performance when WebSocket connections exceed connection pool limits during viral events or market spikes?

**Security & Data Integrity Edge Cases**
- What happens when JWT tokens become compromised and how does the system handle mass token invalidation across multiple devices and services?
- How does the system handle payment processing when external fraud detection services are unavailable during high-value transactions?
- What occurs when audit logging services fail during critical financial operations and how does the system ensure compliance requirements are maintained?

**Service Integration Edge Cases**
- How does the system handle payment gateway webhook failures when confirmation messages are lost, and how does it prevent double-charging or missed payments?
- What happens when CDN providers fail during high-traffic periods and how does the system ensure file delivery across SEA regions with varying network conditions?
- How does the system handle SMS delivery failures for OTP authentication when primary and backup providers are simultaneously unavailable in specific countries?
