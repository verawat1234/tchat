# Backend Services Architecture Research

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Feature**: Backend Services Architecture for Telegram SEA Edition

## Research Objectives

Based on the technical context analysis, research focused on:
1. Go microservices architecture patterns for high-scale messaging platforms
2. Message broker selection for real-time communication at scale
3. Database architecture for multi-region deployment with data residency
4. Payment gateway integration patterns for SEA markets
5. Compliance frameworks for PDPA and PCI DSS in Go applications

## Technology Research

### Programming Language & Framework
**Decision**: Go 1.21+ with gRPC-based microservices
**Rationale**:
- Excellent concurrency support for real-time messaging (goroutines)
- Strong performance characteristics for high-throughput payment processing
- Native gRPC support for inter-service communication
- Rich ecosystem for cloud-native applications
- Strong typing and compile-time checks for financial applications

**Alternatives considered**:
- Java Spring Boot: More mature ecosystem but higher resource usage
- Node.js: Good for real-time but less suitable for financial processing
- Rust: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem and steeper learning curve

### Message Broker Architecture
**Decision**: Apache Kafka for event streaming + Redis for real-time messaging
**Rationale**:
- Kafka provides durable event log for audit trails and eventual consistency
- Redis pub/sub for low-latency real-time messaging (<200ms requirement)
- Both support horizontal scaling and multi-region replication
- Kafka's partition model aligns well with user-based message sharding

**Alternatives considered**:
- RabbitMQ: Simpler but less scalable for 100K+ concurrent users
- Amazon SQS/SNS: Cloud-managed but vendor lock-in concerns
- Apache Pulsar: Good features but less mature ecosystem

### Database Architecture
**Decision**: Multi-database approach with PostgreSQL + ScyllaDB + Redis
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL: ACID compliance for financial data, strong consistency
- ScyllaDB: High-performance timelines for message storage, C++ rewrite of Cassandra
- Redis: Caching and session storage, real-time presence management
- Each database optimized for specific use cases and access patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB: Document model but weaker consistency guarantees for payments
- CockroachDB: Global ACID but higher complexity and cost
- Single PostgreSQL: Simpler but may not scale to 100K+ users

### Authentication & Security
**Decision**: JWT with refresh tokens + OAuth2 for external integrations
**Rationale**:
- Stateless JWT enables horizontal scaling across regions
- 15-minute access token expiry balances security with user experience
- OAuth2 integration required for social login and external services
- Go-specific libraries: golang-jwt/jwt, oauth2

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session-based auth: Requires sticky sessions, harder to scale
- SAML: Overkill for consumer application
- API keys only: Insufficient for user authentication

### Payment Integration
**Decision**: Multi-provider integration with circuit breaker pattern
**Rationale**:
- PromptPay API for Thailand (Bank of Thailand standard)
- Stripe for international transactions and cards
- Local bank APIs for each SEA country (region-specific)
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures during provider outages

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single payment provider: Vendor lock-in and country coverage gaps
- Blockchain/crypto: Regulatory uncertainty in SEA markets
- Cash-only: Limits scalability and user convenience

## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Decomposition
**Decision**: Domain-driven service boundaries with event sourcing
**Services identified**:
1. **Auth Service**: User management, JWT issuance, KYC verification
2. **Messaging Service**: Real-time communication, message persistence, presence
3. **Payment Service**: Wallet management, transaction processing, fraud detection
4. **Commerce Service**: Product catalog, order management, inventory tracking
5. **Notification Service**: Multi-channel delivery, preference management

**Rationale**: Clear domain boundaries reduce inter-service coupling while maintaining business logic cohesion

### Event-Driven Communication
**Decision**: Event sourcing with Kafka + synchronous gRPC for critical paths
**Rationale**:
- Events provide audit trail required for financial compliance
- Eventual consistency acceptable for most user actions
- Synchronous calls for real-time requirements (messaging, payments)
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions across services

### Data Consistency Strategy
**Decision**: Eventual consistency with compensating transactions (Saga pattern)
**Rationale**:
- Strong consistency across services would impact performance
- Financial operations use two-phase commit where required
- Event sourcing enables replay and audit for compliance
- Each service owns its data store (database per service)

## Compliance & Security Research

### PDPA Compliance
**Decision**: Data localization with encrypted storage and consent management
**Implementation approach**:
- Region-specific database deployment for data residency
- Consent tracking with immutable audit trail
- Data export/deletion workflows within 30-day SLA
- Field-level encryption for PII using AES-256

### PCI DSS Level 1
**Decision**: Tokenization with certified payment processor integration
**Implementation approach**:
- No storage of card data (tokenization only)
- TLS 1.3 for all payment communications
- Network segmentation for payment processing components
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Performance & Scale Research

### Load Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Gradual load testing with realistic SEA user patterns
**Approach**:
- Simulate mobile network conditions (3G/4G latency)
- Test burst traffic patterns during regional events
- Validate 100K concurrent WebSocket connections
- Payment processing under 1000 TPS load

### CDN Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-CDN approach with regional edge servers
**Rationale**:
- CloudFlare + AWS CloudFront for redundancy
- Edge servers in Bangkok, Jakarta, Singapore, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City
- Smart routing based on real-time performance metrics
- Sub-100ms asset delivery requirement

## Development & Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
**Decision**: Contract tests + integration tests + unit tests
**Rationale**:
- Contract tests ensure API compatibility between services
- Integration tests validate external service integrations
- Unit tests provide fast feedback during development
- Test containers for database integration testing

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Decision**: GitOps with Kubernetes deployment
**Tools**:
- GitHub Actions for CI pipeline
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment
- Helm charts for Kubernetes configuration
- Multi-stage deployments (dev → staging → production)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Multi-region latency**: Mitigated by CDN and edge caching
2. **Payment provider outages**: Mitigated by circuit breakers and fallbacks
3. **Database scalability**: Mitigated by sharding and read replicas
4. **Security compliance**: Mitigated by regular audits and penetration testing

### Operational Risks
1. **Regulatory changes**: Monitoring compliance requirements across 6 countries
2. **Talent availability**: Go developers with financial domain experience
3. **External dependencies**: Payment providers, SMS gateways, cloud providers
4. **Data residency**: Different requirements per country

## Next Steps
