# Research: Dynamic Content Management with RTK

## Overview
Research findings for implementing dynamic content management using Redux Toolkit infrastructure in the Tchat application.

## Content Management Patterns

### Decision: RTK Query Content Endpoints
**Rationale**: Leverage existing RTK Query infrastructure for content management APIs
- Consistent with established 009-create-rtk-follow patterns
- Built-in caching, invalidation, and optimistic updates
- Type-safe API contracts with TypeScript
- Automatic loading states and error handling

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local state management only: Rejected - no persistence or consistency
- External CMS integration: Rejected - adds complexity, not needed for requirement scope
- File-based content: Rejected - not dynamic, requires deployments

### Decision: Content Types Structure
**Rationale**: Organize content by semantic categories for maintainability
- Text Content: Labels, messages, help text, error messages
- Configuration: Feature flags, app settings, regional preferences
- Media: Images, icons, logos (URLs managed dynamically)
- UI Elements: Button text, navigation labels, form field labels

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flat content structure: Rejected - poor organization, hard to maintain
- Page-based organization: Rejected - content often shared across pages
- Component-based only: Rejected - misses global content like error messages

## RTK Integration Patterns

### Decision: Content Slice + API Endpoints
**Rationale**: Separate content state management from business logic
- Content slice for UI state (selected language, content preferences)
- Content API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Content selectors for efficient component access
- Content middleware for validation and transformation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mixed with existing slices: Rejected - violates separation of concerns
- Pure API-only: Rejected - lacks local state for UI preferences
- Component-level state: Rejected - inconsistent, hard to share

### Decision: Caching Strategy
**Rationale**: Optimize for content access patterns
- Content rarely changes: Long cache TTL (30+ minutes)
- Tag-based invalidation for content updates
- Background refetch for content freshness
- Optimistic updates for content management operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching: Rejected - poor performance for rarely-changing content
- Browser-only caching: Rejected - no invalidation control
- Short cache TTL: Rejected - unnecessary network requests

## Fallback and Error Handling

### Decision: Multi-Level Fallback System
**Rationale**: Ensure application never shows broken content
- Level 1: RTK Query cache
- Level 2: Browser localStorage backup
- Level 3: Hardcoded fallback content (existing values)
- Level 4: Generic placeholder content

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cache-only fallback: Rejected - single point of failure
- Server-side fallback only: Rejected - doesn't handle offline scenarios
- No fallback system: Rejected - violates FR-004 requirement

### Decision: Graceful Degradation
**Rationale**: Maintain user experience during content system failures
- Content loading errors don't break page functionality
- Missing content shows placeholder with clear indication
- Content update failures show user-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for temporary network issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard failures: Rejected - poor user experience
- Silent failures: Rejected - no user feedback on issues
- Aggressive retries: Rejected - could overwhelm failing systems

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Lazy Content Loading
**Rationale**: Load content efficiently based on usage patterns
- Critical content (navigation, errors) loaded on app init
- Page-specific content loaded on route change
- Optional content (help text, tooltips) loaded on demand
- Media content with progressive loading

**Alternatives considered**:
- Eager loading all content: Rejected - poor initial load performance
- Pure lazy loading: Rejected - delays for critical content
- Route-based bundling: Rejected - complexity without clear benefit

### Decision: Content Update Strategies
**Rationale**: Balance freshness with performance
- Real-time updates for critical content (error messages, feature flags)
- Polling updates for frequently changing content (promotions)
- Manual refresh for static content (help text, legal text)
- Version-based invalidation for cache efficiency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Real-time only: Rejected - unnecessary for static content
- Polling only: Rejected - delays for critical updates
- Manual only: Rejected - violates near real-time requirement

## Implementation Architecture

### Decision: Content Service Layer
**Rationale**: Abstract content access patterns for maintainability
- useContent() hook for components
- Content selectors for efficient access
- Content transformers for localization/formatting
- Content validators for type safety

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct RTK Query usage: Rejected - scattered content logic
- Higher-order components: Rejected - outdated React patterns
- Context-based: Rejected - performance issues with frequent updates

### Decision: Type Safety Strategy
**Rationale**: Prevent content-related runtime errors
- TypeScript interfaces for all content types
- Generated types from content schema
- Runtime validation for content payloads
- Compile-time checks for content key usage

**Alternatives considered**:
- Runtime-only validation: Rejected - misses development-time errors
- No validation: Rejected - brittle content system
- Manual type definitions: Rejected - out-of-sync risk

## Security and Validation

### Decision: Content Sanitization Pipeline
**Rationale**: Prevent XSS and content injection attacks
- HTML sanitization for rich text content
- URL validation for media content
- Input length limits for all content types
- Content-Security-Policy integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side only sanitization: Rejected - security risk
- No sanitization: Rejected - major security vulnerability
- Backend-only validation: Rejected - defense in depth principle

## Migration Strategy

### Decision: Gradual Content Migration
**Rationale**: Minimize risk and maintain backward compatibility
- Phase 1: Infrastructure and core content types
- Phase 2: Page-by-page content migration
- Phase 3: Advanced features (versioning, preview)
- Phase 4: Content management UI (if needed)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Big bang migration: Rejected - high risk, difficult rollback
- Feature-flag driven: Rejected - adds complexity for this scope
- External tool migration: Rejected - not aligned with RTK approach

## Research Summary

All technical decisions support the core requirement of replacing hardcoded content with dynamic RTK-managed data while maintaining performance, reliability, and developer experience. The approach builds incrementally on existing RTK infrastructure without introducing new dependencies or architectural patterns.
