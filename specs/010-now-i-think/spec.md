# Feature Specification: Dynamic Content Management System

**Feature Branch**: `010-now-i-think`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "now I think you should replace all pages with data from rtk instead of fix hardcode --ultrathink"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User wants to replace hardcoded data with dynamic RTK-managed data
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users, Content managers, System administrators
   ’ Actions: View dynamic content, Update data in real-time, Manage content centrally
   ’ Data: All static content (text, images, configuration, UI elements)
   ’ Constraints: Centralized data management, real-time updates, maintainability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific data types should be dynamic?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should content be editable by end users or only admins?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Users view pages with dynamic content that updates without code changes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable and focus on user value
6. Identify Key Entities (content types, data sources)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Marked clarifications for ambiguous requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user visiting the application, I want to see current, accurate information on all pages so that I'm always working with up-to-date content without waiting for software deployments to see content changes.

As a content manager, I want to update application content dynamically so that changes are immediately visible to users without requiring developer intervention or application rebuilds.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing any page in the application, **When** content has been updated by a content manager, **Then** I see the updated content immediately without page refresh
2. **Given** I am a content manager, **When** I update text content, images, or configuration values, **Then** all users see the changes across all relevant pages within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable delay time not specified]
3. **Given** the application is running, **When** there are network issues or data source problems, **Then** users see appropriate fallback content instead of broken or missing information
4. **Given** I am viewing content-heavy pages, **When** dynamic content loads, **Then** page performance remains acceptable [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets not specified]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dynamic content source is unavailable?
- How does the system handle malformed or corrupted content data?
- What happens when content updates fail to propagate?
- How does the system handle concurrent content updates from multiple managers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all page content from centralized data sources instead of hardcoded values
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow authorized users to update content without requiring code changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authorization levels and user types not specified]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST see updated content across all pages when changes are made
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fallback content when dynamic data is unavailable
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain content consistency across all pages that reference the same data
- **FR-006**: Content updates MUST be reflected in real-time or near real-time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable update delay not specified]
- **FR-007**: System MUST support different content types including text, images, configuration values, and UI elements
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain content version history for rollback capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: version retention policy not specified]
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate content before making it live to prevent broken experiences
- **FR-010**: Content managers MUST be able to preview changes before publishing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preview functionality scope not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Item**: Represents any piece of information displayed to users (text, images, config values, UI labels)
- **Content Category**: Groups related content items for organization and management
- **Content Version**: Tracks changes to content items over time with metadata about when and who made changes
- **Content Source**: Defines where content originates and how it's managed
- **User Permissions**: Controls which users can view, edit, or publish different types of content
