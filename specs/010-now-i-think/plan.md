# Implementation Plan: Dynamic Content Management System

**Branch**: `010-now-i-think` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/weerawat/Tchat/specs/010-now-i-think/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Replace hardcoded static content across all pages with dynamic RTK-managed data, enabling real-time content updates without code deployments. The system will centralize content management and provide fallback mechanisms for reliability.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3.0 with React 18.3.1
**Primary Dependencies**: Redux Toolkit 2.0+, RTK Query, React-Redux 9.2.0
**Storage**: RTK Query cache with backend persistence (existing RTK infrastructure)
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright E2E
**Target Platform**: Web browser (existing React application)
**Project Type**: web - frontend RTK integration using existing backend APIs
**Performance Goals**: <200ms content load time, seamless content updates without page refresh
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing RTK setup (009-create-rtk-follow), maintain backward compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: All pages in Tchat application, supporting dynamic text, images, config values, UI elements

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected
- Integration with existing RTK infrastructure (no new libraries)
- Builds on established patterns from 009-create-rtk-follow
- Test-first approach using existing test frameworks
- Web application structure already established

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend RTK integration with existing backend APIs

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Content API contract tests → individual test tasks [P]
- Content entities (ContentItem, ContentCategory, etc.) → model/slice tasks [P]
- Content hooks and selectors → utility tasks [P]
- RTK Query endpoint injection → API integration tasks
- UI component content integration → component update tasks
- User story scenarios → integration test tasks
- Fallback system implementation → error handling tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → models → services → UI integration
- Dependency order: Core content types → API endpoints → UI hooks → component integration
- Content slice before API endpoints before UI integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution within each phase
- Fallback system can be implemented in parallel with main features

**Content-Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation** (T001-T010): Content types, RTK slice, basic hooks
2. **API Integration** (T011-T020): RTK Query endpoints, contract tests
3. **UI Integration** (T021-T035): Component updates, content hooks usage
4. **Fallback System** (T036-T045): Error handling, offline support, localStorage
5. **Testing & Validation** (T046-T055): E2E tests, performance tests, quickstart validation

**Estimated Output**: 50-55 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
