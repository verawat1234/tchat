# Feature Specification: Component Level Molecules Breakdown for UI Consistency

**Feature Branch**: `002-breakdown-component-level`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "breakdown component level molecules from ui for consistant"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: Component categorization for UI consistency
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: molecules, UI components, consistency, atomic design
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows identified for developers, designers, QA
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
   ’ Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities (component registry system)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties in scope and criteria"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need a comprehensive breakdown of all molecule-level UI components so that I can ensure consistency across the application, reduce duplication, and accelerate development through component reuse.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to create a new feature, **When** they consult the component breakdown, **Then** they can identify and reuse existing molecule components that match their needs

2. **Given** a designer reviews the UI for consistency, **When** they access the molecule breakdown, **Then** they can identify which components follow standards and which need updates

3. **Given** a QA tester validates UI patterns, **When** they reference the component breakdown, **Then** they can verify that similar functions use the same molecule components

4. **Given** a team lead audits the component library, **When** they review the molecule breakdown, **Then** they can identify redundant components and optimization opportunities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a component doesn't clearly fit the molecule category?
- How does system handle components that serve multiple purposes?
- What occurs when third-party components don't follow atomic design?
- How are platform-specific molecules (mobile vs desktop) categorized?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and catalog all existing UI components in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which parts of the application - entire app or specific sections?]

- **FR-002**: System MUST categorize components according to atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific criteria for categorization?]

- **FR-003**: System MUST document each molecule's composition showing which atomic components it contains

- **FR-004**: System MUST detect duplicate or highly similar molecule components that serve the same purpose

- **FR-005**: System MUST establish consistent naming conventions for all molecule components

- **FR-006**: System MUST provide usage guidelines and examples for each identified molecule

- **FR-007**: System MUST track component usage frequency across the application to identify critical molecules

- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain a visual reference showing each molecule's appearance and variations

- **FR-009**: System MUST identify inconsistencies where similar UI patterns use different component implementations

- **FR-010**: Results MUST be documented in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what format - design system, component library, documentation site?]

- **FR-011**: System MUST support versioning for molecule components to track changes over time

- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that molecules follow [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which design standards and accessibility requirements?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Component**: A reusable UI element with defined visual properties, behaviors, and purpose
- **Molecule**: A UI component composed of two or more atoms working together as a functional unit
- **Atom**: The most basic UI element that cannot be broken down further (buttons, inputs, labels)
- **Component Registry**: Central catalog containing all identified and categorized UI components
- **Consistency Rule**: A defined standard that components must follow for visual and behavioral consistency
- **Usage Pattern**: Documentation of where and how each molecule is used throughout the application

## Areas Requiring Clarification

1. **Scope Definition**: Which parts of the application should be included in the breakdown? (entire Tchat app, web app only, specific features?)

2. **Categorization Criteria**: What specific rules determine if a component is a molecule vs atom vs organism?

3. **Output Format**: How should the breakdown be delivered? (design system documentation, component storybook, markdown files?)

4. **Consistency Standards**: Which specific design standards should be enforced? (Material Design, custom design system, accessibility standards?)

5. **Target Audience**: Who are the primary consumers of this breakdown? (developers, designers, QA, all stakeholders?)

6. **Maintenance Process**: How will the breakdown be kept up-to-date as new components are added?

7. **Priority Components**: Should certain molecules be prioritized based on usage frequency or business importance?
