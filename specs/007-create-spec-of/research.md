# Research: iOS and Android Native UI Screens Following Web Platform

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Complete
**Purpose**: Resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from technical context

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Mobile Performance Targets for Native Screens

**Decision**: Adopt industry-standard mobile performance targets
- **App Launch**: < 3 seconds cold start, < 1 second warm start
- **Screen Navigation**: < 300ms between screens
- **Content Loading**: < 2 seconds for data-heavy screens
- **Scroll Performance**: 60 FPS for smooth scrolling
- **Memory Usage**: < 150MB baseline, < 300MB peak per platform

**Rationale**: Based on Apple and Google platform guidelines, these targets ensure good user experience across modern devices while being achievable with proper optimization.

**Alternatives considered**: More aggressive targets (< 1s launch, < 100ms navigation) were deemed unrealistic for feature-rich screens without significant complexity.

### 2. Offline Capabilities Scope and Data Usage Optimization

**Decision**: Implement tiered offline support with intelligent caching
- **Critical Features**: Authentication state, user profile, navigation history (always available offline)
- **Cached Content**: Recent messages (last 50), store favorites, social feed (last 20 posts)
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync when network available, conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- **Data Optimization**: Image compression, lazy loading, differential sync for large datasets

**Rationale**: Provides meaningful offline experience for core use cases while managing storage and complexity. Follows progressive enhancement pattern.

**Alternatives considered**: Full offline capability for all features was rejected due to complexity; online-only was rejected due to poor mobile UX.

### 3. Platform-Specific Features to Include/Exclude

**Decision**: Implement platform-appropriate native features while maintaining functional parity

**iOS-Specific Inclusions**:
- Haptic feedback for interactions
- Dynamic Type support for accessibility
- iOS-style navigation (back swipe, navigation bar)
- Integration with iOS share sheet
- Face ID/Touch ID for authentication

**Android-Specific Inclusions**:
- Material You theming support
- Android hardware back button handling
- Android-style navigation drawer
- Integration with Android sharing intents
- Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face unlock)

**Excluded Features**:
- Platform-specific APIs that break functional parity (e.g., iOS-only widgets, Android-only live wallpapers)
- Complex integrations requiring separate backend support
- Features requiring additional permissions beyond basic app functionality

**Rationale**: Focus on enhancing UX with native platform conventions while maintaining feature parity. Excluded features would require disproportionate effort or compromise cross-platform consistency.

**Alternatives considered**: Complete platform uniformity was rejected as it would feel unnatural to users; full platform differentiation was rejected as it would complicate maintenance.

### 4. Mobile UI Framework Best Practices Research

**Decision**: Use declarative UI patterns with platform-native state management

**iOS Implementation Approach**:
- SwiftUI with ObservableObject and StateObject for state management
- NavigationStack for navigation hierarchy
- AsyncImage for efficient image loading
- Combine framework for reactive data flow

**Android Implementation Approach**:
- Jetpack Compose with ViewModel and StateFlow for state management
- Navigation Component for type-safe navigation
- Coil for image loading with caching
- Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations

**Rationale**: Declarative UI approaches provide better maintainability, performance, and developer experience. Both platforms have mature ecosystems supporting these patterns.

**Alternatives considered**: UIKit/Views system was rejected for being outdated; React Native was rejected to maintain full native platform integration.

### 5. Cross-Platform Synchronization Strategy

**Decision**: API-first approach with local state management and conflict resolution

**Architecture**:
- Shared REST API endpoints for all platforms
- Local SQLite databases for offline storage (CoreData wrapper on iOS, Room on Android)
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution with user notification for conflicts

**Data Flow**:
```
User Action → Local State Update → API Call → Sync Response → State Reconciliation
```

**Rationale**: Proven pattern that provides good UX (immediate feedback) while maintaining data consistency. Handles network failures gracefully.

**Alternatives considered**: Event sourcing was rejected as too complex; purely online was rejected for poor offline UX; local-first was rejected due to sync complexity.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Core Screens**: Implement main tabs first (Chat, Store, Social, Video, More) before sub-screens
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Begin with basic functionality, add platform-specific features incrementally
3. **Shared Components**: Create reusable component library within each platform following established patterns
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API calls, E2E tests for user workflows
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance tracking from day one to validate target achievement

## Technical Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: UI implementation using established frameworks and patterns
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-platform state synchronization complexity
- **Medium Risk**: Platform-specific feature integration without breaking parity
- **Low Risk**: Performance targets achievable with proper optimization practices

## Next Phase Dependencies

All research complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design with:
- Clear performance targets for implementation
- Defined offline capabilities scope
- Specified platform feature inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Established framework and architecture patterns
