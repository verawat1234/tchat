# Feature Specification: iOS and Android Native UI Screens Following Web Platform

**Feature Branch**: `007-create-spec-of`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create spec of ios and android screen follow web page."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User wants iOS and Android native screens that match web platform pages
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: iOS users, Android users, existing web users
   ’ Actions: navigate, interact, view content, perform transactions
   ’ Data: chat messages, store products, social posts, video content, workspace files
   ’ Constraints: native platform conventions, cross-platform consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets for native screens]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Offline capabilities for mobile screens]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Platform-specific features to include/exclude]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary: User switches from web to mobile and expects identical functionality
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Native screens must match web functionality
   ’ Platform-specific optimizations required
6. Identify Key Entities (screen types, user interactions, data synchronization)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec has some clarification needs around performance and platform features
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user who currently uses the Telegram SEA web application wants to access the same functionality on their iOS or Android mobile device. They expect to see familiar screens with identical features but optimized for mobile touch interaction and native platform conventions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the web application open on desktop, **When** they open the iOS/Android app, **Then** they see the same five main tabs (Chat, Store, Social, Video, More) with identical functionality
2. **Given** a user navigates to any screen in the mobile app, **When** they compare it to the web version, **Then** all core features and content are present and accessible
3. **Given** a user performs an action on mobile (send message, add to cart, like video), **When** they check the web version, **Then** the action is synchronized across platforms
4. **Given** a user has limited mobile data, **When** they use the app, **Then** they can access essential features with optimized data usage
5. **Given** a user uses platform-specific gestures, **When** they interact with the app, **Then** navigation feels native to their device platform

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mobile users access features that work better on desktop (complex workspace collaboration)?
- How does the system handle screen size variations across different mobile devices?
- What occurs when users switch between portrait and landscape orientations?
- How are platform-specific features (iOS haptics, Android back button) integrated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Screen Parity
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide native iOS screens that mirror all web application pages and functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide native Android screens that mirror all web application pages and functionality
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access all five main tabs (Chat, Store, Social, Video, More) on mobile with identical feature sets to web
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain visual consistency across web, iOS, and Android while respecting platform design conventions

#### Main Tab Requirements
- **FR-005**: Chat Tab MUST provide messaging, workspace switching, video/voice calls, and new chat creation
- **FR-006**: Store Tab MUST display marketplace, products, live streams, shopping cart, and vendor interactions
- **FR-007**: Social Tab MUST show social feed, posts, user interactions, and content sharing capabilities
- **FR-008**: Video Tab MUST provide video browsing, playback, likes, subscriptions, and channel management
- **FR-009**: More Tab MUST include user profile, settings, wallet, QR scanner, and app preferences

#### Sub-Screen Requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide authentication screens for secure login/registration
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide settings screens for app configuration and preferences
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide wallet screens for payment and financial features
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide product/shop detail screens for e-commerce functionality
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide video call and voice call screens for communication

#### Platform Integration
- **FR-015**: iOS screens MUST follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines and integrate with iOS-specific features
- **FR-016**: Android screens MUST follow Material Design principles and integrate with Android-specific features
- **FR-017**: System MUST support platform-specific navigation patterns (iOS navigation controllers, Android navigation component)
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle platform-specific hardware features (iOS haptic feedback, Android hardware back button)

#### Data Synchronization
- **FR-019**: System MUST synchronize user data and state between web and mobile platforms in real-time
- **FR-020**: System MUST maintain cross-platform consistency for user preferences and settings
- **FR-021**: System MUST ensure shopping cart, messages, and social interactions sync across all platforms

#### Performance & Accessibility
- **FR-022**: Mobile screens MUST load within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific load time target not specified - 2 seconds?]
- **FR-023**: System MUST support accessibility features on both platforms (VoiceOver, TalkBack, dynamic text sizing)
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offline capabilities not specified - which features work offline?]
- **FR-025**: System MUST optimize for mobile data usage with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific data targets not specified]
