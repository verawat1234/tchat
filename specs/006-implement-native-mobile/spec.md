# Feature Specification: Native Mobile UI & Routing Parity

**Feature Branch**: `006-implement-native-mobile`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement native mobile ui and route follow web --ultrathink"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Implement comprehensive mobile UI and routing system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Mobile app users, web app users
   ’ Actions: Navigate, interact with UI components, maintain consistency
   ’ Data: UI state, navigation state, user preferences
   ’ Constraints: Must follow existing web design patterns
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Navigation depth and hierarchy structure defined
   ’ Component library scope clearly bounded
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: User navigates mobile app with web-like experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focuses on UI/UX parity and routing behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (UI components, routes, navigation state)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Focus on user experience and cross-platform consistency
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Mobile app users should experience the same intuitive navigation and interface patterns as web users, ensuring seamless transition between platforms while maintaining native mobile UX principles.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user familiar with the web application, **When** they open the mobile app, **Then** they can navigate using familiar patterns and find equivalent functionality
2. **Given** a user performing a common workflow (like creating a chat), **When** they follow the same logical steps as on web, **Then** the mobile interface guides them through an equivalent process
3. **Given** a user switching between web and mobile, **When** they access the same features, **Then** the visual hierarchy and information architecture remain consistent
4. **Given** a user navigating deep into the app, **When** they use back navigation, **Then** the routing behaves predictably following mobile platform conventions
5. **Given** a user accessing the app on different screen sizes, **When** they interact with components, **Then** the interface adapts while maintaining design system consistency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user navigates to a deep link that doesn't exist in mobile but exists in web?
- How does system handle navigation state when app is backgrounded and restored?
- What happens when user tries to access web-specific features not available in mobile context?
- How does navigation behave during network connectivity issues?
- What happens when user rotates device during navigation transitions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Mobile app MUST provide equivalent navigation structure to web application
- **FR-002**: Mobile app MUST maintain visual design consistency with web design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to access all core features available in web through mobile-appropriate interfaces
- **FR-004**: Mobile app MUST support deep linking to specific screens matching web URL structure
- **FR-005**: Navigation MUST follow platform-specific conventions (iOS/Android navigation patterns)
- **FR-006**: Mobile app MUST preserve navigation state during app lifecycle events (background/foreground)
- **FR-007**: UI components MUST maintain functional parity with web counterparts while adapting to touch interactions
- **FR-008**: Mobile app MUST support responsive layout adaptation for different device sizes and orientations
- **FR-009**: Navigation MUST provide clear visual feedback for current location and available actions
- **FR-010**: Mobile app MUST handle cross-platform routing for features that bridge web and mobile experiences
- **FR-011**: Interface MUST support accessibility standards equivalent to web implementation
- **FR-012**: Mobile app MUST provide native platform UI patterns (pull-to-refresh, swipe gestures, haptic feedback)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Navigation Route**: Represents a navigable destination in the app, with URL-like structure matching web routes
- **UI Component State**: Manages visual and interactive state of interface elements, synchronized with design system
- **Navigation Stack**: Tracks user's navigation history for proper back navigation and state restoration
- **Deep Link Handler**: Processes incoming URLs and translates them to appropriate mobile navigation actions
- **Platform Adapter**: Handles platform-specific UI behaviors while maintaining cross-platform consistency
- **Layout Container**: Manages responsive layout behavior and component arrangement for different screen contexts
