## T017: Real-time Content Updates Integration Test

**File**: `content-updates.test.tsx`

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (TDD - Test First)

**Purpose**: Validates the complete real-time content update workflow from content modification to immediate UI reflection without page refresh.

### Test Coverage

#### 1. WebSocket Connection Management
- ❌ Establishes WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- ❌ Handles WebSocket connection failures gracefully
- ❌ Attempts reconnection after connection loss

#### 2. Real-time Content Propagation
- ❌ Receives and displays real-time content updates without page refresh
- ❌ Handles high-frequency content updates efficiently
- ❌ Preserves user input during real-time updates

#### 3. Multi-tab/Window Synchronization
- ❌ Synchronizes content updates across multiple tabs
- ❌ Handles content conflicts between multiple editors

#### 4. Update Notifications and User Feedback
- ❌ Displays toast notifications for content updates
- ❌ Shows loading states during content synchronization
- ❌ Displays error messages for failed updates

#### 5. Performance and Resource Management
- ❌ Implements connection pooling for multiple content items
- ❌ Handles memory cleanup on component unmount
- ❌ Throttles updates during rapid content changes

#### 6. Offline and Network Resilience
- ❌ Queues updates when connection is lost
- ❌ Gracefully degrades to polling when WebSocket fails

### TDD Implementation Status

**CRITICAL**: This test MUST FAIL because the implementation doesn't exist yet. This is intentional and required for proper test-driven development.

### Current Test Results
- **16 tests defined**
- **15 tests failing** ❌ (Expected - no implementation yet)
- **1 test passing** ✅ (Error handling test that expects failure)

### Implementation Requirements

To make these tests pass, the following components need to be implemented:

1. **Real-time Connection Service**
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Automatic reconnection logic
   - Connection pooling for multiple content items

2. **Real-time Content Hooks**
   - `useRealTimeContent(contentId)` hook
   - `useContentSync()` hook for synchronization status
   - `useContentUpdates()` hook for receiving updates

3. **Content Update Components**
   - `ContentDisplay` component with real-time updates
   - `ContentEditor` component with conflict resolution
   - Update notifications and loading states

4. **Multi-tab Synchronization**
   - Cross-tab communication via localStorage events
   - Conflict resolution UI for concurrent edits

5. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Offline detection and queuing
   - Fallback to polling when WebSocket fails
   - Network error recovery

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Update throttling and debouncing
   - Memory cleanup on unmount
   - Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Running the Test

```bash
# Run the integration test (should fail until implementation)
npm test -- --run src/__tests__/integration/content-updates.test.tsx

# Run with verbose output to see specific failures
npm test -- --run src/__tests__/integration/content-updates.test.tsx --reporter=verbose
```

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test Implementation**: Complete (this file)
2. ⏳ **Service Implementation**: Implement WebSocket service and connection management
3. ⏳ **Hook Implementation**: Create real-time content hooks
4. ⏳ **Component Implementation**: Build real-time content components
5. ⏳ **Integration**: Connect all pieces and verify tests pass

This follows the TDD red-green-refactor cycle:
- **Red**: Tests fail (current state) ❌
- **Green**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass ⏳
- **Refactor**: Improve implementation while keeping tests green ⏳
