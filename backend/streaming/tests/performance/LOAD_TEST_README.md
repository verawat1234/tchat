# Load Test for 50,000+ Concurrent Viewers

## Overview

Comprehensive load testing suite for validating mega-scale viewer capacity with proper SFU coordination and metrics collection.

## Test Specification (T068)

- **Target**: 50,000 concurrent WebRTC connections
- **SFU Instances**: 10 instances (5,000 viewers each)
- **Performance Targets**:
  - Connection success rate: 100%
  - Average connection time: <5 seconds
  - CPU usage per instance: <70%
  - Memory usage per instance: <4GB
  - Latency distribution: P50, P95, P99 metrics

## Test Structure

### Main Load Test: `TestLoad50KConcurrentViewers`

Three-phase test execution:

#### Phase 1: Connection (Staggered)
- Creates 50,000 viewer goroutines
- Distributes across 10 SFU instances
- Staggers connection timing (10ms intervals)
- Uses coordinator service for load balancing
- Tracks connection success/failure rates

#### Phase 2: Monitoring (5 minutes)
- Collects real-time metrics every 10 seconds
- Monitors CPU and memory usage per instance
- Tracks network bandwidth and latency
- Validates resource limits continuously
- Logs metrics snapshots for analysis

#### Phase 3: Graceful Disconnection
- Concurrent disconnection of all viewers
- Cleanup of WebRTC connections
- Validation of resource cleanup

### Supporting Tests

#### `TestSFULoadBalancing`
- Validates coordinator distributes load evenly
- Tests 15,000 viewer connections across 3 servers
- Verifies each server handles ~33.3% of connections (±10%)
- Validates viewer count synchronization via Redis

#### `TestResourceLimits`
- Validates CPU and memory monitoring infrastructure
- Tests resource limit validation logic
- Simulates resource usage updates

## Metrics Collection

### Connection Metrics
- **TotalConnections**: Total connection attempts
- **SuccessfulConnections**: Successful WebRTC connections
- **FailedConnections**: Failed connection attempts
- **ConnectionTime**: Min, Max, Average, P50, P95, P99
- **ActiveConnections**: Current active viewer count

### SFU Instance Metrics
- **ViewerCount**: Viewers per SFU instance
- **CPUUsagePercent**: CPU utilization percentage
- **MemoryUsageGB**: Memory consumption in GB
- **NetworkBandwidthMB**: Network bandwidth in MB/s
- **ConnectionLatency**: Connection establishment time

### Error Tracking
- **ConnectionErrors**: Map of error types to counts
- **PartitionDistribution**: Load distribution across instances

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25.1+
- Redis server running on localhost:6379
- 10 SFU instances or coordinator service configured

### Quick Run
```bash
cd backend/streaming/tests/performance
go test -v -run TestLoad50KConcurrentViewers
```

### With Custom Configuration
```bash
# Skip short tests
go test -v -run TestLoad50KConcurrentViewers -short=false

# Run all load tests
go test -v -run "TestLoad|TestSFU"
```

## Architecture Integration

### Coordinator Service (T035)
- Uses `CoordinatorService` interface for SFU coordination
- Redis Pub/Sub for viewer join/leave events
- Consistent hashing for geographic load distribution
- Health check monitoring for instance availability

### WebRTC Integration (T042)
- Simulates peer connection establishment
- Data channel creation for viewer communication
- Connection latency measurement
- Proper cleanup and resource management

## Performance Validation

### Success Criteria
✅ All 50,000 viewers connected successfully
✅ Connection success rate >= 100%
✅ Average connection time <= 5 seconds
✅ All SFU instances: CPU <= 70%
✅ All SFU instances: Memory <= 4GB
✅ Load balanced evenly across instances (±10%)

### Failure Scenarios Tested
- Server selection failures
- Connection timeout handling
- Resource limit violations
- Load balancing edge cases

## Implementation Notes

### Staggered Connections
Connections are staggered at 10ms intervals to simulate realistic user behavior and avoid thundering herd problems:
```go
time.Sleep(time.Duration(viewerIdx) * ConnectionStagger)
```

### Resource Monitoring
Real-time metrics collection runs in background goroutine with 10-second intervals:
```go
go collectMetricsPeriodically(metricsCtx, instanceMetrics, metrics)
```

### Atomic Operations
Thread-safe metric updates using `sync/atomic` for concurrent access:
```go
metrics.SuccessfulConnections.Add(1)
metrics.ActiveConnections.Add(1)
```

### Percentile Calculations
Accurate latency distribution analysis using sorted durations:
```go
p50 := ChatPercentile(connectionTimes, 50)
p95 := ChatPercentile(connectionTimes, 95)
p99 := ChatPercentile(connectionTimes, 99)
```

## Dependencies

- `github.com/google/uuid` - Unique identifiers
- `github.com/pion/webrtc/v3` - WebRTC implementation
- `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` - Redis client
- `github.com/stretchr/testify` - Testing assertions
- `tchat.dev/streaming/services` - Coordinator service

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real WebRTC connection establishment (currently simulated)
- [ ] Integration with actual SFU instances
- [ ] System resource monitoring (CPU/memory from OS)
- [ ] Geographic distribution simulation
- [ ] Network condition simulation (latency, packet loss)
- [ ] Viewer behavior simulation (watch duration, interactions)
- [ ] Grafana dashboard integration for real-time metrics
- [ ] Load test orchestration across multiple machines

## Troubleshooting

### Redis Connection Failed
Ensure Redis is running:
```bash
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
```

### Test Timeout
Increase test timeout or reduce viewer count for faster testing:
```go
const TotalViewers = 10000  // Reduced for faster testing
```

### Memory Issues
Monitor system resources during test:
```bash
watch -n 1 'ps aux | grep load_test_check'
```
