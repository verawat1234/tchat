```go
type RecordingMetrics struct {
    FirstSegmentLatency     time.Duration  // <5s target
    SegmentGenerationRate   float64        // segments/second
    AvgUploadThroughput     float64        // Mbps
    RecordingAvailableTime  time.Duration  // <30s target
    TotalStorageUsed        int64          // bytes
    SegmentCount            int
    SegmentContinuity       bool           // No gaps
    LifecyclePolicyApplied  bool
    ExpiryDateSet           bool
    AvgSegmentUploadTime    time.Duration  // <10s target
    P95SegmentUploadTime    time.Duration

}
```

#### 3. PerformanceTarget
Defines all target performance thresholds for validation.

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Recording Start Latency

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd backend/streaming
go test ./tests/performance/recording_test.go -v -timeout 5m
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
cd backend/streaming
go test ./tests/performance/recording_test.go -v -run TestRecordingStartLatency
```

### Run with Benchmarking
```bash
cd backend/streaming
go test ./tests/performance/recording_test.go -v -bench=. -benchmem
```

### Expected Output (Current State)
Tests currently show expected failures because recording service implementation uses placeholders:

```
PASS: TestCDNUploadPerformance (0.01s) - Mock server works
PASS: TestConcurrentRecordingPerformance (15.50s) - Concurrent handling works
FAIL: TestHLSSegmentGeneration (60.00s) - No actual segments generated (placeholder)
FAIL: TestRecordingAvailability (30.50s) - Playlist not generated (placeholder)
FAIL: TestRecordingStartLatency (10.04s) - Timeout waiting for segment (placeholder)
PASS: TestStorageLifecycleDeletion (0.60s) - Lifecycle logic works
FAIL: TestStorageLifecyclePolicy (0.00s) - Minor timing precision issue (fixed)
```

### Expected Output (After Implementation)
Once recording service is fully implemented with FFmpeg integration:

```
PASS: TestRecordingStartLatency (1.2s) - First segment <5s ✓
PASS: TestHLSSegmentGeneration (62.3s) - All segments generated ✓
PASS: TestCDNUploadPerformance (2.5s) - Upload <10s/segment ✓
PASS: TestRecordingAvailability (25.8s) - Available <30s ✓
PASS: TestStorageLifecyclePolicy (0.1s) - Policy configured ✓
PASS: TestStorageLifecycleDeletion (0.5s) - Cleanup works ✓
PASS: TestConcurrentRecordingPerformance (16.2s) - All concurrent pass ✓

Recording Available: 25.8s (target: <30s) ✓
First Segment: 2.3s (target: <5s) ✓
Avg Upload: 8.2s/segment (target: <10s) ✓
```

## Implementation Notes

### Current State
✅ **Complete Test Implementation**: All 8 test cases implemented (696 lines)
✅ **Comprehensive Metrics**: Full metrics collection and reporting
✅ **Mock CDN Server**: Realistic CDN simulation for upload testing
⏳ **Recording Service**: Uses placeholder implementation (Phase 3.6)

### Placeholder Limitations
The recording service (`recording_service.go`) currently contains placeholder implementations:

1. **FFmpeg Integration**: Command structure defined but not executed with real tracks
2. **WebRTC Track Handling**: Track parameter accepted but not processed
3. **S3 Upload**: Upload logic outlined but commented out (needs AWS SDK)
4. **Lifecycle Policy**: Policy setting structure defined but not applied to S3

### Future Implementation Requirements

#### Phase 3.6: Complete Recording Implementation
1. **WebRTC Track Integration**:
   - Pipe WebRTC audio/video tracks to FFmpeg stdin
   - Handle track encoding and packaging
   - Monitor encoding progress

2. **FFmpeg Process Management**:
   - Execute FFmpeg with actual video/audio data
   - Monitor segment generation in real-time
   - Handle FFmpeg errors and recovery

3. **AWS S3 Integration**:
   - Implement actual S3 upload with AWS SDK v2
   - Configure S3 bucket lifecycle policies
   - Handle multipart uploads for large segments

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Parallel segment uploads
   - Streaming segment upload (don't wait for all segments)
   - Memory-efficient encoding

## Performance Benchmarking

### Target Performance (Production)
- **First Segment**: <5s (99th percentile)

- **Storage Efficiency**: 2-3 MB per 6s segment (720p)

### Monitoring Metrics
- First segment latency distribution
- Segment upload time distribution
- Recording availability time distribution
- Storage usage per stream
- Concurrent recording capacity

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Add new test method to `RecordingPerformanceTestSuite`
2. Update `RecordingMetrics` if new metrics needed
3. Update performance report to include new metrics
4. Document new test in this file

### Updating Performance Targets
1. Modify `PerformanceTarget` struct
2. Update validation assertions in tests
3. Update documentation with new targets
4. Run full test suite to validate

### Troubleshooting
- **Timeout Failures**: Increase test timeout or optimize implementation
- **Segment Continuity Failures**: Check FFmpeg segment numbering
- **Upload Failures**: Verify CDN/S3 connectivity and credentials
- **Lifecycle Failures**: Check S3 lifecycle policy configuration
