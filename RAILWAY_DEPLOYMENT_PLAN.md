---

## üöÄ **Phase 1: Prerequisites Setup**

### **1.1 Railway CLI Installation**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli
# OR
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Authenticate
railway login
railway whoami  # Verify login
```

### **1.2 Git Repository Verification**
```bash
# Ensure project is in git repository
git status
git remote -v  # Verify remote repository
```

### **1.3 Environment Validation**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Validate all configuration files exist
ls -la railway-*.toml          # Should show 8 files
ls -la .env.railway-*.template # Should show 7 files
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Phase 2: Infrastructure Services Deployment**

### **2.1 Core Authentication Service (Priority 1)**
```bash
# Deploy Auth Service - Foundation for all other services
./deploy-to-railway.sh

# OR manual deployment:
cp railway-core.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-auth
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

**Expected Result**: `https://tchat-auth.up.railway.app`

### **2.2 Content Service (Priority 2)**
```bash
# Deploy Content Service - Required by Commerce and Video
cp railway-content.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-content
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

**Expected Result**: `https://tchat-content.up.railway.app`

---

## üîß **Phase 3: Core Business Services**

### **3.1 Messaging Service**
```bash
cp railway-messaging.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-messaging
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

### **3.2 Payment Service**
```bash
cp railway-payment.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-payment
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

### **3.3 Commerce Service**
```bash
cp railway-commerce-service.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-commerce-service
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

---

## üì± **Phase 4: Extended Services**

### **4.1 Notification Service**
```bash
cp railway-notification.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-notification
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

### **4.2 Video Service**
```bash
cp railway-video.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-video
railway add postgresql
railway add redis
railway up --detach
```

---

## üåê **Phase 5: API Gateway (Final)**

### **5.1 Gateway Service Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy Gateway LAST - after all services are running
cp railway-gateway.toml railway.toml
railway create tchat-gateway
railway up --detach
```

### **5.2 Gateway Configuration**
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Update Gateway environment variables with actual service URLs:

```bash
# Set service URLs in Railway dashboard
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-auth.up.railway.app
MESSAGING_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-messaging.up.railway.app
PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-payment.up.railway.app
COMMERCE_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-commerce-service.up.railway.app
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-notification.up.railway.app
CONTENT_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-content.up.railway.app
VIDEO_SERVICE_URL=https://tchat-video.up.railway.app
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Phase 6: Environment Configuration**

### **6.1 Database Setup**
Each service automatically gets:
- PostgreSQL database with service-specific schema
- Redis instance for caching and sessions

### **6.2 Environment Variables Configuration**

**For each service**, copy variables from the respective template:

| Service | Template File | Critical Variables |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Auth | `.env.railway-core.template` | JWT_SECRET, TWILIO_* |
| Messaging | `.env.railway-messaging.template` | KAFKA_*, SCYLLA_* |
| Payment | `.env.railway-commerce.template` | STRIPE_*, OMISE_* |
| Commerce | `.env.railway-commerce-service.template` | INVENTORY_*, TAX_* |
| Notification | `.env.railway-notification.template` | FIREBASE_*, APPLE_APN_* |
| Content | None (uses defaults) | - |
| Video | `.env.railway-video.template` | AWS_*, CDN_* |
| Gateway | `.env.railway-gateway.template` | SERVICE_URLs, CORS_* |

---

## üîç **Phase 7: Validation & Testing**

### **7.1 Health Check Verification**
```bash
# Test each service health endpoint
curl https://tchat-auth.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-messaging.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-payment.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-commerce-service.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-notification.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-content.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-video.up.railway.app/health
curl https://tchat-gateway.up.railway.app/health
```

### **7.2 Service Communication Testing**
```bash
# Test service-to-service communication through gateway
curl https://tchat-gateway.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/status
curl https://tchat-gateway.up.railway.app/api/v1/messaging/health
curl https://tchat-gateway.up.railway.app/api/v1/commerce/health
```

### **7.3 Database Migration**
```bash
# Run migrations for each service
railway run --service tchat-auth -- ./auth-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-messaging -- ./messaging-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-payment -- ./payment-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-commerce-service -- ./commerce-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-notification -- ./notification-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-content -- ./content-service migrate up
railway run --service tchat-video -- ./video-service migrate up
```

## üí∞ **Cost Analysis**

### **Monthly Estimates**
- **8 Railway Projects**: 8 √ó $5 = $40/month
- **Database Plugins**: 8 √ó PostgreSQL ($5) = $40/month
- **Redis Plugins**: 8 √ó Redis ($5) = $40/month
- **Traffic & Compute**: ~$20-50/month (varies by usage)

**Total Estimated Cost**: **$120-170/month**

### **Cost Optimization Options**
1. **Consolidation Strategy**: Combine related services into fewer projects
2. **Shared Databases**: Use single PostgreSQL with multiple schemas
3. **External Services**: Use external databases (DigitalOcean, AWS RDS)

---

## üîí **Security Checklist**

### **7.1 Environment Security**
- ‚úÖ All services run as non-root users (tchat:tchat)
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS enabled by default on Railway
- ‚úÖ Environment variables encrypted in Railway dashboard
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoints configured
- ‚úÖ CORS properly configured in Gateway

### **7.2 Network Security**
- ‚úÖ Internal service communication via HTTPS
- ‚úÖ API Gateway as single entry point
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting configured
- ‚úÖ Request/response size limits

### **7.3 Data Security**
- ‚úÖ Database SSL required
- ‚úÖ Redis password authentication
- ‚úÖ JWT token authentication
- ‚úÖ Service-to-service authentication

---

## üéØ **Deployment Execution**

### **Automated Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Single command deployment of all 8 services
cd backend
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

### **Manual Deployment**
Follow Phase 1-7 steps sequentially, ensuring each phase completes before proceeding.

### **Rollback Strategy**
```bash
# If issues occur, rollback individual services
railway rollback --service tchat-[service-name]

# Or redeploy from specific git commit
railway up --commit [commit-hash]
```

---

## üìä **Success Criteria**

### **Deployment Complete When:**
- ‚úÖ All 8 services show "Deployed" status in Railway dashboard
- ‚úÖ All health endpoints return 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Gateway successfully routes to all services
- ‚úÖ Database migrations completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured properly
- ‚úÖ CORS and authentication working

### **Performance Targets**
- üéØ Health check response time: <500ms
- üéØ Service-to-service latency: <200ms
- üéØ Gateway response time: <1s
- üéØ Database connection time: <100ms

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Service Won't Start**
   ```bash
   railway logs --service [service-name]
   railway status --service [service-name]
   ```

2. **Database Connection Failed**
   ```bash
   railway variables --service [service-name]
   railway run --service [service-name] -- env | grep DB
   ```

3. **Service Communication Failed**
   ```bash
   # Check service URLs are correct
   railway variables --service tchat-gateway | grep SERVICE_URL
   ```
